The following CodeSandbox shows a demo application written in ReSift.

We recommend you [open the Sandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/resift-notes-xwp9r) in a new page and play around with it.

---

This is a full demo application including:

- all CRUD actions
- updating data across different "namespaces"
- carefully placed loading spinners

It's note-taking app! Read the pre-made notes to learn more, then edit the code to get better idea of how it works.
