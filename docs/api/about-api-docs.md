These docs are auto-generated by [`generate-api-docs.js`](../TODO.md) which generates the docs based on the ambient typings files within the repository (the `*.d.ts` files).

If you are using an editor that uses the typescript language service (e.g. vs-code, visual studio, webstorm/intelliJ), then you should be able to hover over the definitions within your editor to get the same documentation.

TODO: add screenshot of typings in editors

Please open any issues if you find any within these docs. Open pull requests modifying the `*.d.ts` files.
